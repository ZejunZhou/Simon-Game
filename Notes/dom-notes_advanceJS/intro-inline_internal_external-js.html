<h1>DOM</h1>

<h3>Inline JS</h3>

<p><strong>"on load" is the key words that load js when website is loaded up </strong></p>

<pre style="display:inline;">onload="alert('hello')"</pre> <span>can be placed in html body tag</span>

<em>HELLO should be around with single quotos. Otherwise the browser is confused with double quotes</em>

<hr>

<h3>Internal JS</h3>

<p>place js code in <strong>script tages</strong>, once hit it, run js code </p>

<hr>

<h3>External JS</h3>

<p>Place js code in another file, link it by using <strong>script tags by src</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>The best practice is to place link js at the end (we want to load the content first and then functionality)</p>
