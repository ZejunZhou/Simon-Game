<h1>Position</h1>

<p><strong>Static:</strong>HTML rule by default</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Relative:</strong>Relative postition is relative to where the element would being displayed (static) if is
just follows the natural HTML flow</p>

<h4>Relative Example:</h4>
<p>Right 20px means there is a 20px margin betwween its previous edge and current edge </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Absolute:</strong>Adding the margin relative to its parent element coordinate</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Fixed:</strong>Always fixed to the position relative to the body</p>



<h2>Lay out</h2>
<p><strong>Left, right, top, bottom</strong> if it is relative it does <strong>not</strong> affect how other element display (it will overwriitn or cover</p>

<p><strong>Left, right, top, bottom</strong> if it is absolute it <strong>will affect</strong> how other element display (no longer consider as a part of natural flow)</p>
